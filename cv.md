# 📚 Education

## Master **of Arts in Economics**

School of Economics, University of Hyderabad, Class of *2019*

I took a lot of courses in statistics and finance; however the school's tradition of offering mandatory courses in heterodox thought opened up my horizons and the way to think about issues of the political-economy, class and gender.

Some of my favorite courses were in the fields of Probability Theory, Financial Econometrics and Time Series Analysis. But by the time I enrolled myself at the University of Hyderabad, I was pretty engaged in my work with Law School 101 and had begun working on — what would soon become — the project that launched GrowthCat. I was getting, often times soul-wrenching but eye-opening, lessons in project management, sales and the hustle of nurturing a new business outside the classroom.

## Bachelor **of Arts in Economics**

Fergusson College, Pune University, Class of *2016*

I arrived in Pune a bright-eyed, enthusiastic, eager under-graduate in the monsoon of 2013. Having never-lived by myself before, merely adjusting to hostel life at Fergusson came with some indispensable lessons in self-discipline, personal finance and living an independent life.

In the classroom, I got a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics and economics. I was able to pick-up R and Python and delve into Machine Learning and other "emerging" data methods.  I founded a club - the Economics Circle - to better engage in economics, policy and learning outside the classroom with my peers; and served as a organizer and student editor for a college conference on trade policy.
