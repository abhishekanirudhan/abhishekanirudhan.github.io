#### Welcome to my cozy corner on the internet!

I have a background in **Economics** and **Data**. I am passionate about *education* as a cause, and have worked in the field as a consultant, teacher and entrepreneur.

I currently work at [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/), and I'm trying to do my bit to help India tackle the COVID-19 pandemic with [Hyderabad Covid Resources](https://hydcovidresources.com/).

I also read a lot (and occasionally write)! You can find thoughts, commentary and other takeaway from my reading [here](https://www.notion.so/abhishekanirudhan/Books-a3197fdbf12b4cb499bf71a30cc620e0){:target="_blank"}.

Besides my more "serious" pursuits, I love rock music and enjoy playing the guitar!
