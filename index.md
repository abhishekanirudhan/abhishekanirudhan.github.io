I have a background in **Economics**, however I spent significant time exploring Data Science, Machine Learning and now Deep Learning. I also spent a few years giving flight to my entrepreneurial ambitions at [Law School 101](https://www.lawschool101.in/) & [GrowthCat](https://www.growthcat.in/).

I like playing the guitar.

Just making an edit.
