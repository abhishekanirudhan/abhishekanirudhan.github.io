I have a background in **Economics**, however I spend a significant time exploring Data Science, Machine Learning and now Deep Learning. I also spent a few years giving flight to my entrepreneurial ambitions at [Law School 101](https://www.lawschool101.in/) & [GrowthCat](https://www.growthcat.in/).

I also read a lot (and occasionally write)! You can find my thoughts, commentary and other takeaway from reading [here](https://www.notion.so/abhishekanirudhan/Books-a3197fdbf12b4cb499bf71a30cc620e0){:target="_blank"}.

Besides my more "serious" pursuits, I love rock music and enjoy playing the guitar!
